# Udacity_Landing_Page_Project
<!-- Add banner here -->

<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
This Project's main focus is on JavaScript.
A starter code was provided by Udacity, the objective was to make the page flexible and responsive for different screen sizes.
By flexible I mean, adding a flexible nav menu depending on the number of sections, using this nav menu to scroll to each section
while highlighting the active section in the menu at the same time, all using JavaScript.

# Technologies and Software

I used HTML/CSS & Javascript.
for code editing I use Visual Studio Code.

# Documentation

I depended mainly on W3schools & MDN web docs
I didn't know how to make a dropdown list so I studied an approach on W3schools and implemented it

# Usage

The dropdown menu is responsive, the text content on the drop down button displays the heading of the section in display.
Also when the dropdown list is visible, the section in view is highlighted.
the only down side of this dropdown menu is it's size, it doesn't really stand out.

# Development
I wanted to use the virtual DOM feature to improve performance but the deadline was on me so I focused on the main objectives.
I also wanted to further stylize the drop down menu because it's a bit small and need to stand out more, but I wasn't able to do it 
for the same reason, so I apologize for any inconvenience.
