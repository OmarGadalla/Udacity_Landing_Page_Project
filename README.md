# Udacity_Landing_Page_Project
<!-- Add banner here -->

<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
This Project's main focus is on JavaScript.
A starter code was provided by Udacity, the objective was to make the page flexible and responsive for different screen sizes.
By flexible I mean, adding a flexible nav menu depending on the number of sections, using this nav menu to scroll to each section
while highlighting the active section in the menu at the same time, all using JavaScript.

# Technologies and Software

<!-- Add a demo for your project -->
I used HTML/CSS & Javascript.
for code editing I use Visual Studio Code.
<!-- After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
I wanted to use the virtual DOM feature to improve performance but the deadline was on me so I focused on the main objectives.
I also wanted to further stylize the drop down menu but I wasn't able to do it for the same reason, so I apologize for any inconvenience.
<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->





### Adding new features or fixing bugs
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is to give people an idea how they can raise issues or feature requests in your projects. 

You could also give guidelines for submitting and issue or a pull request to your project.

Personally and by standard, you should use a [issue template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and a [pull request template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/PULL_REQ_TEMPLATE.md)(click for examples) so that when a user opens a new issue they could easily format it as per your project guidelines.

You could also add contact details for people to get in touch with you regarding your project. -->

# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->

Leave a star in GitHub, give a clap in Medium and share this guide if you found this helpful.
